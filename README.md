# fmsg

Fmsg is the repository for fast messaging among Internet hosts.
  In contrast to other messaging environments where the endpoints stay
  long term, i.e., connections stay for long time. Fmsg handles messaging when connections
  are ephemeral, i.e., connections between endpoints last for a very short time (in milliseconds).
