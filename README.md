# fmsg

Fmsg is the repository for fast messaging among Internet hosts.
In contrast to other messaging environments where the endpoints stay
long time, i.e., connections are long-lasting (hours or longer), fmsg works in environments where connections
are ephemeral, i.e., connections between endpoints last for a very short time (in milliseconds).
A reliable UUDP protocol suites well for such application scenarios.
